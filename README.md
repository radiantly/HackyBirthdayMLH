# Hack it, Share it!

Official hack for the Hacky Birthday MLH Hackathon by Team Cheesy!

### Inspiration

During each hackathon, in our rush to build a working project, we learn so much. Sometimes, these are small tidbits of information that's too small or trivial to blog about. It could be anything, from something as simple to bypassing cors, to aligning an element with css. Whatever the case, this thing that you spent some time googling is worth sharing with the hackers of the world! Platforms like StackOverflow encourage you to ask about something you got wrong. We're looking to reverse this trend, let's share what we got right instead!

### What it does

Hack it, Share it! is a cross-platform app built with flutter that lets you share anything that other hackers might find helpful. It uses the Google Maps SDK to display the map and the markers indicating individual hacks, and Firebase as a back-end.
